Here are the data structures with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_anim_sprite}{Anim\+Sprite}} \\*An \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_anim_sprite}{Anim\+Sprite}} is composed of a sprite which points to the current frame bitmap. The map is switched when it\textquotesingle{}s time to show the next animation (according to the frames\+\_\+per\+\_\+map attribute). According to the direction of the animated sprite, it may be flipped horizontally }{\pageref{struct_anim_sprite}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_button}{Button}} \\*A \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_button}{Button}} is composed by two sprites -\/ one with solid color, and one with colored frame to represent the hover -\/ and a text that will be written in its center (with the desired font) }{\pageref{struct_button}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_font}{Font}} \\*A \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_font}{Font}} is composed of each letter sprite, in its original size and zoomed 2x }{\pageref{struct_font}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_game}{Game}} \\*A \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_game}{Game}} holds information about the mouse, the player, the map and the font to write the buttons and timer. Clues and endgame messages are stored in a panel that is mutable during the game }{\pageref{struct_game}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_instructions}{Instructions}} \\*\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_instructions}{Instructions}} is a panel wrapper with big padding between the text, aligned left, and a corresponding image to each text string }{\pageref{struct_instructions}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_map}{Map}} \\*A \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_map}{Map}} holds information about the blocks for each position, and the sprites corresponding to each one, in original size and zoomed with the corresponding zoom factor. Since the zoomed map moves, the relative position of the map top left is also stored }{\pageref{struct_map}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_menu}{Menu}} \\*The \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_menu}{Menu}} holds buttons to the different game states, and a title. Stores the instructions and the settings but not the game }{\pageref{struct_menu}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_panel}{Panel}} \\*A \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_panel}{Panel}} is composed of a title, a solid background, text strings and a close button }{\pageref{struct_panel}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_player}{Player}} \\*A \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_player}{Player}} is composed of its sprite and a series of attributes related to the its movement in the map, e.\+g x\+\_\+abs and y\+\_\+abs representing the absolute position in the zoomed map, and speed the step of the sprite per movement }{\pageref{struct_player}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_resources}{Resources}} \\*\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_resources}{Resources}} is a wrapper to the main objects allocated and manipulated by the app state handlers }{\pageref{struct_resources}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_settings}{Settings}} \\*\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_settings}{Settings}} is a panel wrapper with aditional buttons (options) at the bottom to the first panel string }{\pageref{struct_settings}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_sprite}{Sprite}} \\*A \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_sprite}{Sprite}} holds the width, height, x and y positions and the bitmap of an object that shall be drawn on the screen. If x are y, negative mean that the top left of the sprite is indeed ouside of the screen, and only a part of the sprite is shown }{\pageref{struct_sprite}}{}

# LCOM

Labs and final project developed for LCOM 2020/2021.

**Intended as a help resource. Be aware of plagiarism!**

## Rewrites

I rewrote the programming labs each year that I was a class assistant for the course. They should be semantically similar to the original versions, although with different style. Some of them are more experimental, e.g. the 23/24 rewrite that includes a thin wrapper around IHs to make multi-device handling easier.
